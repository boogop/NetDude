Remember NetBoy?

Yeah well neither does anybody else. I think I was the only one who ever used that thing but I found it incredibly useful. This is a proof of concept app to see if I could do something similar. It uses SharpPCap, which needs WPCAP (good luck finding that thing) to work. The idea is pretty simple: draw a circle segmented into dots of .05 radians, then assign an IP to each dot and connect them with lines, depending on who's talking to whom.
